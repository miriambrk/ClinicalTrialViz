# Two Projects: Pyber and Pymaceuticals Homework 

1) Pyber - a hypothetical ride-sharing company

Reads the data files (CSV format) and use Pandas and matplotlib and/or Seaborn to plot the data. Observable trends are documented.

1) a Bubble Plot showcases the relationship between four key variables:
- Average Fare ($) Per City
- Total Number of Rides Per City
- Total Number of Drivers Per City
- City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

2) three pie charts:
- % of Total Fares by City Type
- % of Total Rides by City Type
- % of Total Drivers by City Type


2) Pymaceuticals - a hypothetical pharmaceutical company's drug trial results

Reads the data files (CSV format) with drug trial information, and use Pandas and matplotlib and/or Seaborn to plot the data. Observable trends are documented. Compares how four different treatments work.
- a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
- a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
- a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
- a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
